# Bonus challenge:

● How can you add a block to multiple pages (but not all) without duplicating the layout instructions?

If you want to add a block to multiple pages without duplicating the layout instructions, you can create a custom widget
for the block and add the widget to each page where you want the block to appear.
Here are the steps to create a custom widget:

● In the Magento Admin Panel, go to Content > Widgets and click "Add Widget".

● Choose the widget type "CMS Static Block" and click "Continue".

● Fill in the widget information, including the Widget Title, Assign to Store Views, and Layout Updates.

● In the "Widget Options" section, select the static block that you want to add to the widget and configure any other
options as needed.

● Save the widget and repeat the process for any additional pages where you want to add the block.
